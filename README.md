mpdrandom.py
============
Is a script to play random mpd albums either at the end of an album or manually.
#Usage
run the script manually to play a random album from your playlist, or run it
with the --daemon flag to play a random album at the end of each playlist. (see --help for more options)
#Thanks
Thanks to [kmac](https://github.com/kmac/mpdscripts/blob/master/mpd-random-pl-album.py). His script inspired me to make my own.
