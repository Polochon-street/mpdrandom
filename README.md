Is a script that adds some randomness to mpds albums.

# Features

* Daemon mode: Play a random album when you reach the end of the current one.
* Shuffle: Shuffle all albums in the current playlist.

#Usage
run the script manually to play a random album from your playlist, or run it
with the --daemon flag to play a random album at the end of each playlist. (see --help for more options)

#Thanks
Thanks to [kmac](https://github.com/kmac/mpdscripts/blob/master/mpd-random-pl-album.py). His script inspired me to make my own.
